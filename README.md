# Comrade Yuri VS Code Theme

## Currently in progress

I enjoyed the concept of the Rainglow Comrade theme, however I wanted brighter text colors for more contrast. This is just that.

## Themes

Comrade Yuri - Dark Theme with slight tweaks to up contrast on characters
Comrade Yuri A11y - A11y friendly contrast tweaks to theme
Comrade Yuri Light - Contrast, though a11y friendly, tweaks to character contrast
Comrade Yuri Contrast - Unmodified as of now.

## TODO:

- [ ] More a11y friendly contrast for original light
- [ ] More a11y friendly contrast for original dark theme
- [ ] More a11y friendly contrast for original contrast theme
- [ ] Gruvbox color alternates for each 3.
- [ ] My own spin on each 3

# Comrade Yuri VS Code Theme

I enjoyed the concept of the Rainglow Comrade theme, however I wanted brighter text colors for more contrast. This is just that.

## Currently in progress

## TODO:

[] More a11y friendly contrast for original light
[] More a11y friendly contrast for original dark theme
[] More a11y friendly contrast for original contrast theme
[] Gruvbox color alternates for each 3.
[] My own spin on each 3
